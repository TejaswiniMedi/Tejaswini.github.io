I am a PhD candidate from the [Visual-Computing Group](https://www.vc.informatik.uni-siegen.de/) at the University of Siegen, guided by [Prof.Dr.-Ing. Margret Keuper](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=KMqMQAcAAAAJ&hl=de). I received my Master's in Mechatronics from the University of Siegen and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Osmania University, India with Distinction. My areas of research include 3D Generative Models, Neural Network Robustness, and 3D Geometric Learning. During my master's, I also worked as a student researcher in the field of Reinforcement Learning. It would be my pleasure to collaborate on interesting topics within these domains ðŸ˜€!
